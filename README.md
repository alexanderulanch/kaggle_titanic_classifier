# Titanic Kaggle Competition Classifier

This is a classifier for the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, and passenger class.

To create this classifier, the following methods were taken:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The data was cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as imputation of missing values, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and dropping irrelevant features.

2. Feature scaling: The features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that the model is not biased towards features with larger magnitudes.

3. Model selection: A Random Forest classifier was chosen as the model due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: The hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier were tuned using GridSearchCV to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the model's accuracy.

5. Cross-validation: The performance of the final model was estimated using cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different test sets.

The resulting classifier achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, which was submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation.

To use this classifier, the following steps can be taken:

1. Install the required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

2. Download the training and test data from the Kaggle competition website.

3. Run the code to train and evaluate the classifier on the training data.

4. Run the code to make predictions on the test data and submit the predictions to the Kaggle competition website.

Please refer to the comments in the code for more detailed information about each step of the process.
